## Rounds

Skips: **Not allowed**.

**Round 2 — One Word**
You may say **one word only** per card.
Skips: **Allowed** until you cycle back to your starting card for that turn, then **your turn ends automatically**.

**Round 3 — Charades**
**No words**. Non-verbal sounds and gestures are OK.
Skips: **Allowed** until you cycle back to your starting card for that turn, then **your turn ends automatically**.

## Turns

* The app tells you who holds the phone each turn.
* Hit **Correct** when the guessers get it.
* **Complete all cards** in your turn → save your remaining time as **bonus time** for your next turn!
* **Pause button** lets you pause mid-turn; **End Turn** button lets you end early with confirmation.
* **Timer end**: the current card is pushed to the bottom automatically and a recap opens.
* **Turn Recap**: only **read out loud** the highlighted correct answers; you can toggle highlight.
* **Undo** on a recap removes that correct, **reinserts the card** at its prior position for this round, and reduces the score.

## Guessing & “No-say” Chips

* Title words render as **chips** for the clue-giver; those are the words you cannot say.
* If the title begins with **The/A/An**, that chip is **grey/optional** for guessing. All other tokens (including “of/and/in”) are considered required by the rules.
* Rules are **case-insensitive** and ignore punctuation. Plurals are **not** auto-forgiven — players should match number (“cat” ≠ “cats”).

> The app doesn’t do speech recognition; **players** enforce guesses and these rules. The chips are there to keep everyone honest.

---

## Skips (detail)

* **Round 1**: none (Skip hidden).
* **Rounds 2–3**: Skips are unlimited **until** the deck cycles back to the **starting card of your turn**; then **your turn ends automatically** with a confirmation screen.

---

## Deck & Scoring

* Deck order is **stable within a round**. Cards you **Skip** or **time out on** are sent to the **bottom**.
* Between rounds, the deck is **shuffled**, but it’s the **same cards**.
* Scores show **this round** and **cumulative** totals after the round ends.
* Ties are fine; the app calls it out.

---

## Player Intake

* Collect Team A first, then Team B.
* Each player sees **N candidates** and must pick **M**.
* Bad or duplicate titles are auto-replaced so the deck ends up with **one card per submitted pick**.

---

## Notes

* Timer default is **60s**.
* **Player Statistics** are tracked throughout the game and displayed at the end showing turns taken, correct answers, and timing data.
* Haptics on key actions; clean, minimal UI in a Letterpress-like style.
* Tiny rule reminder: leading **The/A/An** is optional when guessing.
