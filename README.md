## Turns

* The app tells you who holds the phone each turn and shows **cards remaining** for that turn.
* Hit **Correct** when the guessers get it.
* **Complete all cards** in your turn → save your remaining time as **bonus time** for your next turn!
* **Get Ready screen** shows bonus time when available and lets you start when ready.
* **Top controls**: **Pause** and **End** buttons with icons stay fixed as timer changes.
* **Turn notifications**: Clear explanations for timer end, manual end, or completing all cards.
* **Pause menu**: Unpause, adjust timer settings (affects next round), or end game entirely.
* **Cards counter**: Shows cards remaining this turn, plus diagnostics (skipped/correct/total).
* **Turn Recap**: only **read out loud** the highlighted correct answers; you can toggle highlight.
* **Undo** on a recap removes that correct, **reinserts the card** at its prior position for this round, and reduces the score.

## Guessing & “No-say” Chips

* Title words render as **chips** for the clue-giver; those are the words you cannot say.
* If the title begins with **The/A/An**, that chip is **grey/optional** for guessing. All other tokens (including “of/and/in”) are considered required by the rules.
* Rules are **case-insensitive** and ignore punctuation. Plurals are **not** auto-forgiven — players should match number (“cat” ≠ “cats”).

> The app doesn’t do speech recognition; **players** enforce guesses and these rules. The chips are there to keep everyone honest.

## Skips (detail)

* **Round 1**: none (Skip hidden).
* **Rounds 2–3**: Skips are unlimited **until** you've processed all cards available at turn start (via skips + correct answers); then **your turn ends automatically** with a confirmation screen.

---

## Deck & Scoring

* Deck order is **stable within a round**. Cards you **Skip** or **time out on** are sent to the **bottom**.
* Between rounds, the deck is **shuffled**, but it’s the **same cards**.
* Scores show **this round** and **cumulative** totals after the round ends.
* Ties are fine; the app calls it out.

---

## Player Intake

* Collect Team A first, then Team B.
* **Name validation**: Must be unique and non-blank; errors appear only after typing begins.
* Each player sees **N candidates** and must pick **M**.
* **Full card selection**: Tap anywhere on a card to select it, not just the circle.
* Bad or duplicate titles are auto-replaced so the deck ends up with **one card per submitted pick**.

---

## Notes

* Timer default is **60s**.
* **Player Statistics** are tracked throughout the game and displayed at the end showing turns taken, correct answers, and timing data.
* Haptics on key actions; clean, minimal UI in a Letterpress-like style.
* Tiny rule reminder: leading **The/A/An** is optional when guessing.
